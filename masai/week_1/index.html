            <h2 style = "font-family: 'Staatliches', cursive"><u>Creation and conceptions</u></h2>
                <em style = "font-family:'Bangers', cursive">Tsugumi obha</em>, the writer of the series, created L as a young adult, since he believed the story would not hold much interest if L were significantly older than his opponent, Light. For L's name, he wanted to use a single letter with a lot of significance; he considered "I" and "J", but eventually he chose "L" after careful consideration.<br>
    
            <h3>Film adaptation</h3><br>
                Matsuyama had trouble portraying L and worried about his performance. He reasoned that L rarely interacted with others, and so portrayed him as if he did not "quite understand other people on an emotional level". Describing himself as "not very flexible physically", Matsuyama had trouble emulating L's postures.He also ate sweets like those that L would eat, and considered the details of L's signature gestures.
    
            <h2 style = "font-family: 'Staatliches', cursive"><u>Appearances</u></h2><br>
    
            <h3>In <i>Death note</i></h3>
                L, who also uses the aliases <i>Hideki Ryuga, Ryuzaki,Eraldo Coil, and Deneuve</i>, the latter two for which he has developed reputations as the second- and third-best detectives in the world, is quite secretive and only communicates with the world through his assistant Watari.
    
            <h3>In films</h3>
                L is portrayed by <i>Kenichi Matsuyama <i>in the live-action films that adapt the Death Note manga, with his portrayal and characterization of the character receiving wide praise for being earnestly faithful to his original manga counterpart. Unlike the manga, in the second film, his "death", caused by Rem writing his name in her Death Note, does not take effect, as L had written his own name in Misa's Death Note earlier.
    
            <h3>In other media</h3>
                In the light novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note_Another_Note:_The_Los_Angeles_BB_Murder_Cases">Another Note: The Los Angeles BB Murder Cases,</a>, L recruits FBI agent Naomi Misora to investigate a series of murders. While the story includes several phone discussions with him from Misora's perspective, he only appears in person at the end of the novel, when he goes by the name "Ryuzaki" - an alias he appropriates from the novel's serial murderer, Beyond Birthday, who masquerades as L under the alias "Rue Ryuzaki". The light novel also says that L won the aliases Eraldo Coil and Deneuve in a "detective war" with the real Coil and Deneuve.<br>
